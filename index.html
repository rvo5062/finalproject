  For my project I thought about creating a questionnaire for high schoolers looking to swim in college can fill out and send to each school they wish to talk to in the future. Currently, recruits are filling out questionnaires for each individual school they wish to contact and they are all nearly exactly the same. Each school might use a different platform to collect each questionnaire so my proposal would be to put everything together and have the recruit only fill out a single questionnaire and send to multiple different schools at the same time.

  In this project I plan on using technologies such as Spring MVC and something like a HashSet or a HashMap, depending on which one would work best with collecting the data. Using something such as a HashMap can be beneficial for storing all of the information gathered by multiple different individuals that submit a questionnaire about themselves. Some of the use cases that would be used for this could be collecting recruit information, view list of schools, view list of athletes and send conformations. Conducting these use cases are important because the main point of the project is to collect all of the recruit's information in a neat and understandable way to ease the recruiting process for both athletes and coaches. Allowing the athlete to view a list of school	s and vice versa with the coaches and athletes eliminates the problem of researching where to discover who they both wish to contact. Sending conformations is important because it notifies each party that they either successfully completed a questionnaire or that the school has a new recruit they may with to contact in the future.

  A timeline of my project would start off by defining and working more on discovering my use cases and how complex each one is. By the first checkpoint I would hope to have the basic Spring MVC layout complete to be able and add more to it as time goes on. Once I get more feedback on my current state and have a better understand of where I am and where I need to be I can update this schedule. The final project will hopefully look like the average questionnaire currently used for the recruiting process but with a few extra aspects. A main login page would be present that can be used to log in and fill out their information and save for future use. Once everything is complete, they can move to a list of all potential schools they wish to contact and select each one. The last step would be to submit their information and it would be sent to every school they selected previously.

    I think that this project is interesting because when I was in high school and still to this day 4 years later, the same processes is required to contact the schools of your choice. It is repetitive and unnecessary to fill out the same information five to ten times when it can just be completed once and be done. It is similar to the Common Application used for applying to colleges but for athletes looking to compete in college. One of the most asked questions I received from recruits taking official trips here was "what is your advice for the recruiting process", and I always said to fill out questionnaires to every school you are thinking about attending. It's extremely important to get their name out there because coaches might not always find them the first few times and it shows that they are interested in the program. It is a good showcase of my abilities because it requires me to use many different aspects of coding in ways I haven't previously. It will require a lot of research and time to make sure everything runs properly. It will also require many users so holding everyone's information can be challenging but something that is important to work with in the future.
